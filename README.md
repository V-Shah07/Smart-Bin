# Smart-Bin: AI-Powered Waste Sorting Solution

## Project Overview

The Smart-Bin is an AI-driven smart garbage can designed to simplify and enhance waste sorting. Using machine learning, this innovative bin automatically distinguishes between recyclable and non-recyclable items, contributing to more efficient recycling and reduced waste contamination. The Smart-Bin is ideal for schools, offices, and homes where waste sorting can have a big impact on sustainability efforts.

## Features
### AI-Powered Sorting: 
Utilizes computer vision to identify waste materials and determine their recyclability.
### Single Bin, Multiple Uses: 
Designed to sort different types of waste within one container, reducing the need for multiple bins.

## Technical Specifications
### Language: Python
### Machine Learning Model built using transfer learning
### Hardware: Compatible with Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller for cost-efficient deployment
### Camera: Real-time image capture to analyze items as they are thrown in the bin
### Actuator: Motor system to direct waste into separate compartments based on recyclability

## How It Works
### Image Capture: The Smart-Bin takes a photo of each item as it is thrown in.
### Object Recognition: The AI model analyzes the image and identifies the object.
### Sorting Mechanism: The bin uses an internal actuator to direct the item to the appropriate compartment.

## Usage

### Simply place waste items in the Smart-Bin, and it will sort items automatically.
### For best results, ensure items are clearly visible when placed in the bin to enhance image capture accuracy.

## Future Improvements
### Expanded Waste Types: Further training the model to recognize more types of recyclables and non-recyclables.
### Mobile Application Integration: Developing an app to provide real-time feedback, statistics, and user engagement.
### IoT Compatibility: Integration with IoT platforms for remote monitoring and data collection
